This page is devoted to papers and talks that are closely tied to this project (the products of the funded work and the exploratory research that we conducted when planning and writing the proposal).

We are working on < <a href="http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/fossil/?page_id=97">a page</a> with an annotated bibliography of closely related literature. We just started that, so there is not much posted there, yet.
