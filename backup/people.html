<a href="http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/content/tracy-heath">Tracy Heath</a> is a part-time postdoctoral researcher on the grant, but she had a major role in designing and writing the proposal. Tracy develops Bayesian approaches for estimating divergence times. She will be expanding these methods to include better models of character evolution and to enable fully Bayesian analyses of diversification rates.

<h2>Other Personnel</h2>
<a href="http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/content/jordan-koch">Jordan M. Koch</a> is an undergraduate student working in the Holder lab to develop the algorithms required to correct for ascertainment biases. She works in the Holder lab. Thus far, she has not been funded by this grant; her funding comes from an NIH grant to <a href="http://www2.ku.edu/~imsd">KU's Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity</a>
