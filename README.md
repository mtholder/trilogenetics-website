Trilogenetics-website
=====================

http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/fossil/ is web page for a project to improve likelihood-based
analyses of fossil phylogenetics with Trilobites as a model system. That site is
a wordpress site, but we'd like to have some substantive content which would be 
tedious to manage via web page. This git repo holds content such as a BibTeX 
file of references. This collection of references will be periodically
used to update:
